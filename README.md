#### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is an objective method of making decisions or inferences from sample data (evidence). 
Sample data is used to choose between two choices i.e. hypotheses or statements about a population. 
Typically this is carried out by comparing what we have observed to what we expected if 
one of the statements (Null Hypothesis) was true.

Key terms:  

NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0) is a statement about the population & sample data used to decide whether to reject that statement or not. 
                 Typically the statement is that there is no difference between groups or association between variables. 

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H1) is often the research question and varies depending on whether the test is one or two tailed. 

SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, (also known as a type 1 error). 
                    This is decided by the individual but is normally set at 5% (0.05) which means that there is a 1 in 20 chance of 
                    rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. 

TEST STATISTIC is a value calculated from a sample to decide whether to accept or reject the null (H0) and varies between tests. 
                    The test statistic compares differences between the samples or between observed and expected values when the 
                    null hypothesis is true. 

P-VALUE: the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as ours if the null is true and there 
         really is no difference or association in the population of interest. 
         P-values are calculated using different probability distributions depending on the test. 
         A significant result is when the p-value is less than the chosen level of significance (usually 0.05). 
         
         

The court case : 
Hypothesis testing can be thought of as a court caseMembers of a jury have to decide whether a person is guilty or 
innocent based on evidence presented to them.

Null: The person is innocent
Alternative: The person is not innocent.

The null can only be rejected if there is enough evidence to disprove it and the jury do not know whether the person 
is really guilty or innocent so they may make a mistake.
