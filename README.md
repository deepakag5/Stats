Statistics Basics and Advanced


#### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is an objective method of making decisions or inferences from sample data (evidence). 
Sample data is used to choose between two choices i.e. hypotheses or statements about a population. 
Typically this is carried out by comparing what we have observed to what we expected if 
one of the statements (Null Hypothesis) was true.

Key terms:  

NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0) is a statement about the population & sample data used to decide whether to reject that statement or not. 
                 Typically the statement is that there is no difference between groups or association between variables. 

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H1) is often the research question and varies depending on whether the test is one or two tailed. 

SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, (also known as a type 1 error). 
                    This is decided by the individual but is normally set at 5% (0.05) which means that there is a 1 in 20 chance of 
                    rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. 

TEST STATISTIC is a value calculated from a sample to decide whether to accept or reject the null (H0) and varies between tests. 
                    The test statistic compares differences between the samples or between observed and expected values when the 
                    null hypothesis is true. 

P-VALUE: the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as ours if the null is true and there 
         really is no difference or association in the population of interest. 
         P-values are calculated using different probability distributions depending on the test. 
         A significant result is when the p-value is less than the chosen level of significance (usually 0.05). 
         
         

The court case : 
Hypothesis testing can be thought of as a court caseMembers of a jury have to decide whether a person is guilty or 
innocent based on evidence presented to them.

Null: The person is innocent
Alternative: The person is not innocent.

The null can only be rejected if there is enough evidence to disprove it and the jury do not know whether the person 
is really guilty or innocent so they may make a mistake.


#### Confidence Interval

The Confidence interval is the range of values that we believe will have a specified chance of containing 
the unknown population parameter.

It gives us the information about the precision of a point estimate such as the sample mean.

Confidence Intervals describe the variability surrounding the sample point estimate (the wider the interval, 
the less confident we can be about the estimate of the population mean). In general, all things being equal, the 
larger the sample size the better (more precise) the estimate is, as less variation between sample means is expected.

In simple terms, CI will tell you the most likely range of the un-known population mean or proportion.

The confidence is in the method, not in any interval.


Three things affect the width of a confidence interval:

1. Confidence Level: usually 95%.

2. Variability: if there is more variation in a population, each sample taken will fluctuate more and wider 
the confidence interval. The variability of the population is estimated using the standard deviation from the sample.

3. Sample size: without lowering the confidence level, the sample size can control the width of a confidence interval, 
having an inverse square root relationship to it.


#### P-value  

Expresses the probability that extreme results obtained in an analysis of sample data are due to chance. 
We choose the probability level or p-value that defines when sample results will be considered strong enough to 
support rejection of the null hypothesis. A low p-value (for example, less than 0.05) means that the null hypothesis 
is unlikely to be true. With null hypothesis testing, all it takes is sufficient evidence (instead of definitive proof) 
that we can see as at least some difference. The size of the difference is given by the confidence interval around the 
difference. 

A small p-value might occur:

1. by chance
2. because of problems related to data collection 
3. because of violations of the conditions necessary for testing procedure 
4. because H0 is true If multiple tests are carried out, some are likely to be significant by chance alone!

For sigma = 0:05,we expect that significant results will be 5% of the time. Be suspicious when you see a few 
significant results when many tests have been carried out or significant results on a few subgroups of the data.
